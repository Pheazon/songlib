the song library project was done by Haseeb Balal (hhb10) and Muffadal Hussain (mmh240). IntelliJ idea was used as an IDE, so the setup and installation was somewhat different than using Eclipse. In terms of setting the IDE up, javafx was downloaded and was put into the library in order to use it, the vm arguments were also changed following the guide provided by the professor on sakai. The steps were followed from the website (https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/). JSON was also used in order to read and write data and to preserve the state simple java by Google was used and was added to the project structure in order to use it. The jar file was downloaded from (https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/downloads), version 1.1.1 was used and the necessary imports were also made.

In terms of the project it compiles and runs perfectly, there should be no issues if the setup was done correctly. The main stage allows one to see the song list, add a song, edit a song and delete a song. When editing a song a had some issues having the function on the same scene so we decided on making another scene to take care of that function. Other requirements were also met such as having no duplicates or empty fields for name and artist. The year can only be a 4 digit number.
